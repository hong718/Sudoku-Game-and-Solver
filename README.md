# Sudoku-Game-and-Solver
This application is written in python, using pygame.\
You can play Sudoku yourself or use the Sudoku solver in this application!

The sudoku puzzles in this game are generated according to the following three metrics.

First metric: the number of given cells\
Second metric: the lower bound of given cells in each row and column\
Third metric: the solving time by computer using Backtracking

Then, a sudoku puzzle is graded according to these three metrics and separated into three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Difficult).\
Since the sudoku puzzle will only be generated once you choose the difficulty, it may take some time to do so.
