# Sudoku-Game-and-Solver
You can play Sudoku or find the solution of your own Sudoku puzzle in this application.

The sudoku puzzles in this game are generated according to the following three metrics.

First one: the number of given cells
Second one: the lower bound of given cells in each row and column
Third one: the solving time by computer using Backtracking

Then, a sudoku puzzle is graded according to these three metrics and separated into three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Difficult).
Since the sudoku puzzle will only be generated once you choose the difficulty, it may take some time to do so.
